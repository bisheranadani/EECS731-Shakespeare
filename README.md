# EECS731-Shakespeare
## This repository is for the classifier project for EECS731. In the project, I used pandas and scikit learn to classify a Shakespeare play data set based on the Player that said a line. The classifier models used were decision tree and random forest.
### The notebook containing my work can be found right away in the repository under To be, or not to be.ipynb
